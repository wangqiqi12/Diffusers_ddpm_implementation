# Diffusers_ddpm_implementation
This repository is used for ddpm implementation using diffusers!

I have come through a lot of coding pitfalls which trouble me for mouths. To avoid these pitfalls I have written a [summary](https://github.com/wangqiqi12/Diffusers_ddpm_implementation/blob/main/diffusers_ddpm_implementation_summary_of_pitfalls.md) for you. 
If you have other bugs in your implementation, I'm glad to receive your issue. Hope you can avoid the bugs and reimplement the FID successfully!
